### `npm run dev`

This is the only command you need to run in development. It will start the following processes for you:

- bundling
- typechecking

### `npm run build`

This runs bundling with minification turned on. You should run this command before releasing your widget.

### `npm run test`

This runs typechecking and makes sure that your widget builds without errors.
