# Figma and FigJam Widget Samples

Widgets are custom, interactive objects you place in a [Figma](https://figma.com) or [FigJam](https://figma.com/figjam) file to extend functionality.

Widgets are written in a declarative style similar to React components, so developers can define what a widget looks like using a component-based API similar to React. If you have written React before you should feel right at home.

A widget is just a “pure function” that returns what gets rendered inside of a node. They can also have their widget run arbitrary code in response to various user interactions, such as click events. Widgets also have custom property menus similar to FigJam objects.

So far developers have built widgets for people to use together — like voting, polls, and on canvas games. You can see a full list of published [widgets here](https://www.figma.com/community/widgets/widgets).
